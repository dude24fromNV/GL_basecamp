# Lee algorithm

 The purpose of the algorithm is to lay the shortest path from the start cell to the ending cell, if that is possible, of course. In the two-dimensional map (matrix) consisting of a "walk-through" and "no walk-through" cell. We needed selected  start cell  and finish cell.
 
 *Algoritm have some steps:*
 
    - Initialization of start and finish points 
    - Wave expansion
    - Backtrace
    
## About program

Program have two argument it is width and height of map. After start program generates random map and we need choose start point and finish point. In finish we can see way and wave on the map.
